# winChain Builder - From Drakenza #

### If this is the project you've been waiting for, or sounds like exactly what you need, consider [Donating](http://tinyurl.com/2us6xj) or [Digg it](http://digg.com/apple/winChain_Sets_up_the_iPhone_toolchain_on_Windows_within_minutes). ###

## We now have a [preBuiltToolchain torrent](http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3920191) (also available in the Downloads section. However, my computer is having problems seeding so it is preferred that you use Megaupload. ##

## winChain has been updated to 1.0.1 to fix the bug with copying files. 1.0.2 is imminent and will fix the bug with the Cygwin button being greyed out. Until then, just run the installer in the Resources folder. ##

## The preBuiltToolchain file can be downloaded from [here](http://tinyurl.com/2vtug9), or if you prefer BitTorrent, [at TPB](http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3920191). ##

winChain is simple: Download the builder software from the Downloads section, then download the 500mb pre-Built Toolchain files from the MegaUpload link. Then simply run winChain, direct it to preBuiltToolchain.zip, and let it work its magic.

It'll go something like this:
  1. You'll download the two files.
  1. You'll download WinRAR and extract preBuiltToolchain.rar.
  1. You run winChain.exe and it'll ask for the preBuiltToolchain folder.
  1. You'll wait a little while as winChain copies the file (it should only take a second).
  1. winChain will launch the Cygwin installer. You just have to keep clicking "Next" until it completes... no special options or anything.
  1. winChain will alert you that you're good to go, and put a Cygwin shortcut on your Desktop.
  1. You can now use Cygwin to built iPhone apps. To test, navigate to "/HelloApplication" in Cygwin and type in "make" and the Hello World application should build.
  1. winChain also includes a iPhone application template builder ("winChain Template Builder.exe"), and an option to install Notepad++ (in my opinion, the best code-notepad out there), so that you can be coding in no time.

Feel free to contact me if you have problems getting winChain to work, or if you need some programming help :) You can contact me at winchainbuilder@gmail.com. Please **don't** send winChain-related emails to idemocracy@gmail.com!
